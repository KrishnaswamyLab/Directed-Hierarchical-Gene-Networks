# Directed-Hierarchical-Gene-Networks

Comparison of representation approaches for gene embeddings, especially with directed and hierarchical structure, for study of intra- and intercellular signaling.


Hyperparameter optimizations in `FILE.sh`.
Configurations in `config.py`.
Main `train.py` calls functions.

Example run from current directory:
```
python train.py --model Node2Vec --dataset omnipath
```
